            <p>Visions Project is an interactive device that allows visualization of psuedo 3-D objects.Those objects are projected onto a pyramidal structure with a LCD monitor, and due to the special geometry of the structure, any user located around the pyramid is able to see a 3Â·-D image floating inside of the pyramid for any observer located around the pyramid. The structure uses a Kinect camera in order to capture the external movement of the people and to allow a real time interaction user-object.</p>
            <p>The project was conceived as a DIY (do it yoursef) portable open software project. The structure is light and easy to build and dismantle. The information to create it, build it and make it work is shared with a Creative Commons license.</p>

            <p>The project was developed by Francesca Mereu and Javier Villarroel.</p>
